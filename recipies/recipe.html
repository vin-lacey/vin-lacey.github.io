    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>140g <strong>Plain Flour</strong></li>
        <li>4 Large <strong>Eggs</strong></li>
        <li>100ml <strong>Full-Fat Milk</strong></li>
        <li>100ml Cold <strong>Water</strong></li>
        <li>¼ tsp <strong>Salt</strong></li>
        <li>Approx. 60-80ml <strong>Beef Dripping</strong> (traditional, best flavour) OR <strong>Lard</strong> OR a neutral <strong>Vegetable Oil</strong> with a high smoke point (like rapeseed or sunflower oil) - enough for about 1-2 tsp per muffin cup.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yields:</strong> 12 puddings (using a standard muffin tin)</li>
        <li><strong>Prep time:</strong> 10 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Resting time:</strong> 30 minutes (minimum)</li>
        <li><strong>Cook time:</strong> 20-25 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12-hole standard <strong>muffin tin</strong> (or a 4-hole traditional Yorkshire pudding tin)</li>
        <li>Large <strong>mixing bowl</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Whisk</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Jug</strong> (for easy pouring)</li>
        <li><strong>Sieve</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Batter:</strong> Sieve the flour and salt into the large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the well. Using the whisk, start whisking the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour from the sides until you have a thick, smooth paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Liquids:</strong> Slowly whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until fully combined and smooth. Then, gradually whisk in the cold water. Continue whisking until the batter is smooth and has the consistency of thin cream. Don't overmix, just ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the Batter:</strong> Cover the bowl (or transfer the batter to the jug, cover) and let it rest at room temperature for <em>at least 30 minutes</em>. You can also rest it in the fridge for longer (even overnight), but let it come back towards room temperature for about 30 minutes before using. Resting allows the flour to fully hydrate, which helps achieve a better rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven and Fat:</strong> Preheat your oven to <strong>220°C (200°C Fan / Gas Mark 7)</strong>. Add about 1-2 teaspoons of your chosen fat into each cup of the muffin tin. Place the tin into the hot oven for 10-15 minutes until the fat is <em>extremely hot</em> – it should be shimmering or lightly smoking. This step is <strong>critical</strong> for the puddings to rise properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour the Batter:</strong> Give the rested batter a quick whisk. Carefully remove the smoking hot tin from the oven (use oven gloves!). Quickly and confidently pour the batter from the jug into each cup, filling them about half to two-thirds full. Work fast so the tin doesn't cool down too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Immediately return the filled tin to the hottest part of the oven. Bake for <strong>20-25 minutes</strong>. <strong><em>Do not open the oven door for at least the first 20 minutes</em></strong>, or they might collapse. They should be well-risen, deep golden brown, and crisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the oven and serve immediately while they are tall and hot, traditionally alongside roast beef and gravy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hot Fat:</strong> The fat <em>must</em> be sizzling/smoking hot when the batter goes in.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Oven:</strong> A high, consistent oven temperature is essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Rested Batter:</strong> Don't skip the resting step.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Peek:</strong> Avoid opening the oven door early in the baking process.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature (ish) Batter:</strong> If refrigerated, let the chill come off the batter before pouring into hot fat.</li>
    </ul>
