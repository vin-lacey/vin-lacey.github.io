            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>140g <strong>Plain Flour</strong></li>
                <li>4 Large <strong>Eggs</strong></li>
                <li>100ml <strong>Full-Fat Milk</strong></li>
                <li>100ml Cold <strong>Water</strong></li>
                <li>¼ tsp <strong>Salt</strong></li>
                <li>
                    Approx. 60-80ml <strong>Beef Dripping</strong> (traditional,
                    best flavour) OR <strong>Lard</strong> OR a neutral
                    <strong>Vegetable Oil</strong> with a high smoke point (like
                    rapeseed or sunflower oil) - enough for about 1-2 tsp per
                    muffin cup.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recipe Details</h2>
            <ul class="details-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Yields:</strong> 12 puddings (using a standard
                    muffin tin)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prep time:</strong> 10 minutes</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Equipment Needed</h2>
            <ul class="equipment-list">
                <li>
                    12-hole standard <strong>muffin tin</strong> (or a 4-hole
                    traditional Yorkshire pudding tin)
                </li>
                <li>Large <strong>mixing bowl</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Whisk</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Sieve</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Batter:</strong> Sieve the flour and salt
                    into the large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre. Crack
                    the eggs into the well. Using the whisk, start whisking the
                    eggs, gradually incorporating the flour from the sides until
                    you have a thick, smooth paste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Combine Liquids:</strong> Slowly whisk in the milk,
                    a little at a time, until fully combined and smooth. Then,
                    gradually whisk in the cold water. Continue whisking until
                    the batter is smooth and has the consistency of thin cream.
                    Don't overmix, just ensure there are no lumps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rest the Batter:</strong> Cover the bowl (or
                    transfer the batter to the jug, cover) and let it rest at
                    room temperature for <em>at least 30 minutes</em>. You can
                    also rest it in the fridge for longer (even overnight), but
                    let it come back towards room temperature for about 30
                    minutes before using. Resting allows the flour to fully
                    hydrate, which helps achieve a better rise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Preheat Oven and Fat:</strong> Preheat your oven to
                    <strong
                        >$220^{\circ}$C ($200^{\circ}$C Fan / Gas Mark
                        7)</strong
                    >. Add about 1-2 teaspoons of your chosen fat into each cup
                    of the muffin tin. Place the tin into the hot oven for 10-15
                    minutes until the fat is <em>extremely hot</em> – it should
                    be shimmering or lightly smoking. This step is
                    <strong>critical</strong> for the puddings to rise properly.

                    <strong>Pour the Batter:</strong> Give the rested batter a
                    quick whisk. Carefully remove the smoking hot tin from the
                    oven (use oven gloves!). Quickly and confidently pour the
                    batter from the jug into each cup, filling them about half
                    to two-thirds full. Work fast so the tin doesn't cool down
                    too much.

                    <strong>Bake:</strong> Immediately return the filled tin to
                    the hottest part of the oven. Bake for
                    <strong>20-25 minutes</strong>.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hot Fat:</strong> The fat <em>must</em> be
                    sizzling/smoking hot when the batter goes in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hot Oven:</strong> A high, consistent oven
                    temperature is essential.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rested Batter:</strong> Don't skip the resting step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don't Peek:</strong> Avoid opening the oven door
                    early in the baking process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Room Temperature (ish) Batter:</strong> If
                    refrigerated, let the chill come off the batter before
                    pouring into hot fat.
                </li>
